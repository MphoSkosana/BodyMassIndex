# BodyMassIndex
This project serves to calculate a person's body mass index (BMI).
The system takes in the person's name, age, height and weight as input.
It processes the data by dividing the weight by the square of the of the height and produces the BMI.
The BMI is then put into different categories [underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese].
The system then produces the the BMI and the category as the output to the user.
